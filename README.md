# programming-fundamentals
lab tasks:

* Lab 2 – Simple Escape Sequences

Learned to use escape sequences like \n, \t, and \\.
Completed three simple tasks using formulas.


* Lab 3 – Basic Formulas

Three tasks using basic formulas and simple calculations.
Practiced computation and output formatting in C++.


*  Lab 4 – Even/Odd & Conditional (Ternary Operator)

Three tasks: checked if numbers are even or odd.
Used ternary operator to apply conditions.


* Lab 5 – If / Else Conditions

Eight tasks using if and if-else statements.
Applied single or multiple conditions as required.


* Lab 6 – If, Else & Else-If

Three tasks using if, else, and else-if statements.
Practiced multiple decision-making conditions in C++.


* Lab 7 – Nested If

Completed tasks using nested if statements.
Focused on multi-level decision-making in programs.


* Lab 8 – Switch Statement
  
 tasks using the switch statement for multi-way branching.
Used switch-case to handle multiple conditions efficiently, especially for menu-driven programs.


 * Lab 9 – While and Do-While Loops
   
Six tasks implemented using both while and do-while loops.
Practiced entry-controlled (while) and exit-controlled (do-while) loops, ensuring that do-while executes at least once.


 * Lab 10 – For Loop
   
 tasks using the for loop for definite iteration.
Focused on counter-controlled loops to repeat actions a specific number of times.


 * Lab 11 – Arrays
   
 tasks focused on using loops to traverse and manipulate arrays.
Implemented programs to initialize, reverse, and find the largest number within an array of integers.
